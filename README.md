 ## Writing down in English helps organizing the process of starting a programming project.
 
Writing down (comments here or elsewhere) in English step by step what you want to be done 

helps organizing the process. 

See below (as written in Jupyter):

comment and action, comment and action, comment and action, etc...

STEP 1: Go into the company system (in our case, the link above, stored in the Course's Google Drive.)

&emsp;&emsp;pyautogui.hotkey("ctrl", "t")

&emsp;&emsp;pyperclip.copy("https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149xknr9JvrlEnhNWO49zPcw0PW5icxga?usp=sharing")

It must be pyperclip.copy, not "pyautogui.write"

&emsp;&emsp;pyautogui.hotkey("ctrl", "v") (note: to indent in markdown I'm using two `&emsp;`)

&emsp;&emsp;pyautogui.press("enter")

STEP 2: Navigate in that system to find the database (in uou case, go into the "export" folder.)

STEP 3: Download (export) the database.

STEP 4: Import the database to Pyton.

STEP 5: Calculate the indicators.

STEP 6: E-mail the report to the board of directors.
 
 Pyautogui library is perfect for commanding actions to e mouse, keyboard and screen.
 
 It works together with pyperclip.
 
 Install both. (only once ans forever it's ok).
 
 But every time you start coding in Pyton and will use them you must IMPORT them.
 
pyautogui.hotkey (a set of keys to be "pressed")

pyautogui.write (to write a text)

pyautogui.press (press 1 key)


 STEP 1: Go into the company system (in our case, the link above, stored in the Course's Google Drive.)
 
 * pyautogui.hotkey("ctrl", "t")
 

 STEP 2: Navigate in that system to find the database (in our case, go into the "export" folder.)

 STEP 3: Download the database.

 STEP 4: Import the database to Pyton.

 STEP 5: Calculate the indicators.

 STEP 6: E-mail the report to the board of directors.
